# Versus-JS - InnerHTML Approach in ES6

This folder contains the following files:

| Name | Description |
| ---- | ----------- |
| [ES6/index.html](ES6/index.html) | An ES6 submission by Travis Wagner that uses innerHTML to create extremely tight code |
| [ES6/bugfixed.html](ES6/bugfixed.html) | Same as index.html, but fixes the NaN bug and moves page value to tag attributes |
| [jQuery/index.html](jQuery/index.html) | Original jQuery code but with the coding style updated to match Travis' version. Also changes semantics of Content for configurability and nested component creation to match ES6 version |
